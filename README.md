# Family Album

The idea is to use an "old" tablet (galaxy tab) as a Digital Photo Frame, but
in a way where is possible to my family send pictures and them will be showed
on my Digital Photo Frame.

Important point: I would like to do this on a more free-way (as in freedom)
possible.

There are many roads to be walked down, so probably I will try some of them.

## Road 1

### General Idea
* Telegram bot written in Python to receive the pictures
  (https://github.com/gabrielfedel/petunia_bot)
* The bot runs on Tab, using Pydroid (not libre :( )
* Use the Android Gallery to see the pictures

### What has worked
* Bot runnint on android!

### What hasn't worked
* Android Gallery doesn't update pictures list when in Slide Show mode

## Road 2 - TBD

### General Idea
* Same as Road 1, but using a different program to see pictures (may develop
  one using Android Studio)


## Road 3 - TBD

### General Idea
* Use telegram bot as Road 1
* Create a web application in python to show pictures
* Run everything on Android

## Road 4 - TBD

### General Idea
* Same as Road 4, but running on another device (computer, Raspiberry pi,
  remote server, ...)
* Android just access the address to see the pictures

## Road 5 - TBD

### General Idea
* Build a bot and a picture viewer using Android Studio
